The freighter ship was supposed to pick you up
several months ago, but it never came.
Your contact from the corporation went on sick leave
and never returned.
Then the communication channel closed.
In the faint radio broadcasts you capture with
your make-shift aerial you hear garbled fragments
of news ... virus .... millions dead

Luckily the expedition ship Aurora is returning
from their last multi-year Jovial mission.
They don't have enough fuel to pick you up,
but it is in your hands to harvest enough
helium-3 to change their minds.
This might be the last chance to get out of
this foresaken barren rock.

Start with building a harvester
and then work expeditiously
to gather 5 tanks of helium
before the expedition ship
passes the point of no return.
use WASD to drive around and
mouse to interact with the harvesters.
You have to choose beteen storing helium
and building more harvesters
